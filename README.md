# Kaggle Competitions

I participate in interesting Kaggle competitions from time to time. My primary goal is to develop my understanding of machine learning. I participate in both current and past competitions. When a current competition I participate ends, I continute to research ways to improve performance.

This repo summarizes a few competitions that I have participated.

## [Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition)

### My Status

* My Official Rank: # 128 (Top 10%)
* My Late Submission Rank: # 12 (Top 1%) - submission after deadline


### Competition Overview

The task is to distinguish images of dogs from cats. To elaborate, we want to train a deep
neural network to tell whether any given image is a dog or a cat, assuming that the input image is
always either a dog or a cat, but not both at the same time. Further details are explained in the
competition homepage.


### My Story with This Competition

This was my first encounter with deep learing using GPU.

I first participated in this competition when taking an [online course](http://course.fast.ai/index.html) taught by Jeremy Howard, former president of Kaggle. In that course, Jeremy taught how to fine-tune the VGG-16 model to solve this problem. In the homework, he has asked us to get into top 50% of the competition. Back then, the competition was still open to submissions, and I have tried hard to score high on the leaderboard. I have mainly followed Jeremy's teaching, but added a little bit of my own creativity as well. After 23 submissions, I have finally ranked No. 128 out of 1314 teams (__Top 10%__). Guess what? __Jeremy was immediately below me on the leaderboard__, ranked No. 129. I felt excited and surprised, and motivated to learn more about machine learning.

After the competition deadline has passed, I tackled the problem again as my capstone project for Udacity's [Machine Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). Thanks to the new knowledge I learned from the program, I have improved my unofficial late submission rank to __Top 2%__.

Everytime I learn some new technique or idea, I try it out on this problem. My newest late submission score ranks __Top 1%__.
